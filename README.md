- 👋 Hi, I’m John (@WheelockJ)
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, software asset management and sustainable agriculture.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for interesting topics to learn more about data analysis as well as project management, automation of data transformation/visualization and perhaps learn more about programming, particularly in the field of IT asset management or sustainable agriculture.
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on any projects, they say practice makes perfect and the best way to learn is by diving right in.
- 📫 How to reach me is through here at the moment.
